# NIST Time Scale Data Visualization

📊 A data visualization project analyzing NIST time scale data and leap seconds (2020–2024) using R.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was developed for the **LSC 563 Data Visualization** course (Spring 2025) and explores how leap seconds and UT1–UTC time variations impact global timekeeping. The final deliverables include:

- Cleaned and wrangled NIST data (2020–2024)
- Interactive and static visualizations created in R
- Studied data visualization in R and Exploratory Data Analysis
- PDF presentation summarizing findings
- Reflection and analysis of time corrections and Earth rotation

## 📁 Files Included

- `presentation_DV_RT.pdf`: Final presentation (submitted version)
- `data/`: Cleaned CSVs and source data files
- `code/`: R scripts for data wrangling, analysis, and plotting
- `.gitignore`: Configuration to ignore system files (e.g., `.DS_Store`)
